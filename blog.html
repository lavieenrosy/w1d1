          <p><span style="color: #00c7b7">MEGAN - </span> London will always hold a place in my heart. It's a sometimes cold and its Industrial Revolution history sometimes shows a little too clearly, but it is a fascinating mix of the old and the new. History's arc is so clear to me in this city, where you can see the plundered treasures of colonialism at the British Museum or take pictures with the thoroughly modern looking Gherkin. (insert pic). Buckingham Palace is a perfect example of the way that the old has hung on to this city as it has aged--how many countries still have a royal family? There are endless sights, but I would demand that any visitors check out a musical on the West End, wander Covenant Gardens, see Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery, and give yourself at least two hours in the British Museum. We also visited the market in India Town on a Sunday morning for brunch to great effect, because everything there was delicious, and Camden provided some local colour. I would skip the London Eye, Big Ben, and frankly most of the churches. If you must visit a church, St. Paul's over West Minster Abbey is my vote. Don't forget to grab an oyster card (train pass) when you arrive--you'll need it. The Tube is the best (only) way to get around the city and you will get to know a few important train lines during your stay. It's not really cheap, but nothing is in London. Oh, and Harry Potter Studios in Levesden is so completely magical, you'll kick yourself if you don't make the trip out. </p>
          <p><span style="color: #00c7b7">ROSY - </span> For me, London was a mix of modern and ultra old, plus the deep-rooted feeling that I had always known the place. You don't quite realize how much London stars as a character in media until you realize that every landmark and place you go was also coincidentally in the show you just watched. Some of my most vivid snapshots of memory are from London: catching a glimpse of the London Eye from the airplane, walking across the millennium bridge (the one that gets destroyed by deatheaters in Harry Potter) with St. Paul's in the distance, a sea of poppies in front of the Tower of London (Sherlock), big bed from the Thames, the Globe (Shakespeare in Love), and a stroll along the South Bank. I also adored being a consumer of London culture: taking the tube (the Picadilly Circus! Amazing!), sipping a Snakebite (Guiness + black current syrup) at the “pub,” perusing the Sunday market on Brick Lane, and grabbing a bite at the food market in Little India Town. Checking out Camden and Greenwich are a must, as is buying a ticket for the Harry Potter tour at Warner Bros Studios MONTHS ahead of time.</p>
